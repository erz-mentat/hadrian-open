# HADRIAN

Citizen-to-citizen warning infrastructure.

No government filter. No corporate black box. 

Raw reports — from anyone, anywhere — into validated, structured alerts.
Fast. Transparent. 

---

## The Problem

Emergency alerts today are either:
- government-controlled [slow, top-down, fax machines]
- proprietary [closed, limited, expensive]
- crowdsourced chaos [WhatsApp groups, no validation]

There is no *infrastructure* for validated citizen-to-citizen warnings.

## What HADRIAN Does

Takes unstructured citizen reports [text, later audio/image/video]
and turns them into structured, auditable events:

```
raw report → normalize → extract → geo-resolve → deduplicate → score → alert
```

Every step is explicit. Every decision is traceable.

## What This Repo Is

HADRIAN is not open-source.

But most of: the architecture, the design decisions, and event schema go public.
Because *how* a system thinks should not be a secret.

Transparency is not a risk. It's a principle.
